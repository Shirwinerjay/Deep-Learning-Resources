# Deep-Learning-Resources

This is basically a collection all resources which I found to be useful for studying the theory of Deep Learning.

[1] Course from deeplearning.ai : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w/playlists

The explanations for CNNs are quite good. In addition they have a section for sequential modeling coming soon!

[2] RNN's : The lectures by Prof Ali Ghodsi at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvyhbrQptHk&t=4047s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAt9_4IhC7s&t=8s are excellant. In addition to learn more about LSTM and GRU's please look through the blog post here http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/
