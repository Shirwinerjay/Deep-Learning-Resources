Hi

I am trying to go through each of the tutorials and trying to put it in ipython notebooks 
with more comments so that they are better explained

hope they are helpful

Things left to do --
------------

[1] learn about the different attention mechanisms. It will be good to get better models working.
This is not absolutely necessary. There are many PyTorch Codes floating around.

I would definately suggest to atleast look through some of them.

[2] Beam Search : This is extremely important as presently we are using greedy search.
Greedy search works much worse than that of Beam Search.
One implementation is here
