These are files to study about NLP in the pytorch

pytorch tutorials 
------------------------------------

[2] https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch and 

-- this has been moved into the official pytorch tutorial sections 

https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-intermediate-char-rnn-classification-tutorial-py

https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial.html

https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html

For understanding the working of sequence 2 sequence networks 

I should atleast go over these papers : 

(a) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3215.pdf

(b) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf

(c) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04025.pdf

[5] https://github.com/eladhoffer/seq2seq.pytorch

https://github.com/eladhoffer/captionGen

[6] https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-CortexNet -- Implementations of different LSTM Cells. I had a short discussion with 
AtCold. He seemed very helpful.
