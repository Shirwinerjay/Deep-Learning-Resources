Here I am listing all the resources I am using to learn about GAN's and their implementations 
I will be mostly focussing on the Pytorch learning framework 

[1] GAN general implementations 
https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-generative-model-collections

[2] WGAN and WGAN Improved 
https://github.com/martinarjovsky/WassersteinGAN
https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp

[3] ACGAN -- two implementations are available 
-- does not use class information on D and G as inputs
https://github.com/gitlimlab/ACGAN-PyTorch 
https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-generative-model-collections/blob/master/ACGAN.py 

doubt : should it use class information ?

[4] GAN and DCGAN : https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-MNIST-CelebA-GAN-DCGAN
CGAN and CDCGAN : https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-MNIST-CelebA-cGAN-cDCGAN

[6] Coupled GAN COGAN
