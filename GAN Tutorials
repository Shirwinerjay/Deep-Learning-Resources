Here I am listing all the resources I am using to learn about GAN's and their implementations 
I will be mostly focussing on the Pytorch learning framework 

[1] GAN general implementations 
https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-generative-model-collections
https://github.com/wiseodd/generative-models
https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN
https://github.com/sunshineatnoon/Paper-Implementations

[2] WGAN and WGAN Improved 
https://github.com/martinarjovsky/WassersteinGAN
https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp

[3] ACGAN -- two implementations are available 
-- does not use class information on D and G as inputs
https://github.com/gitlimlab/ACGAN-PyTorch 
https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-generative-model-collections/blob/master/ACGAN.py 

doubt : should it use class information ?

[4] GAN and DCGAN : https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-MNIST-CelebA-GAN-DCGAN
CGAN and CDCGAN : https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-MNIST-CelebA-cGAN-cDCGAN

[5] GAN HACKS

[6] Coupled GAN COGAN

[7] Disco GAN
https://github.com/carpedm20/DiscoGAN-pytorch
https://github.com/SKTBrain/DiscoGAN -- original authors
https://github.com/sunshineatnoon/Paper-Implementations/tree/master/DiscoGAN

[8] Adverarially learned inference !
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00704.pdf
https://github.com/IshmaelBelghazi/ALI -- original authors
https://ishmaelbelghazi.github.io/ALI/ -- original authors

*** NOTE the training part of the GAN is different in both ***
*** To note which is the correct one I have to go through the original authors implementation***
*** Looking at algorithm 1 in paper I found that ozansener's implementation is matching ***
https://github.com/ozansener/GAN/tree/master/bigan -- another implementation
