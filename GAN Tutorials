Here I am listing all the resources I am using to learn about GAN's and their implementations 
I will be mostly focussing on the Pytorch learning framework 

[1] Vanila GAN 
-- main paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661
-- first implementation
https://github.com/devnag/pytorch-generative-adversarial-networks
-- a second implementation
https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2017/01/20/gan-pytorch/

[2] DCGAN
-- main paper : 
Soumith's own code 
https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/dcgan/main.py
